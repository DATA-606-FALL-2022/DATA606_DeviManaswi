### FINAL PROPOSAL

### Credit Card Predictive Analysis

Name: Devi Manaswi Kallam

## Background:

Even though the cash has more value than anything in this world, people prefer credit cards for payments. As we know that people use credit cards for many reasons. Most of the people use credit cards as it is safe and easy to carry around. Some of them find it easy to track their spending and get better rewards without changing their spending limits. And there is also a major reason that anyone can build their credit histories. So, with good credit history a person can get another card or housing, educational loans, insurance approved.  

Credit card applications are frequently sent to banks. In a variety of circumstances, service providers must first consider their customers' credit histories before determining whether to offer the service. Many of the applications are turned down for a variety of reasons, including large loan balances, low-income levels, or an applicant's credit report having too many enquiries. It is tedious, time-consuming, and prone to error to manually analyze these applications. In this project, we will automate the process of predicting credit card approval and credit scoring using Machine Learning algorithms. Though this it will be easy to understand what factors affect these target variables the most.

## Dataset:

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction

There are two datasets, one is application record (54.34MB) consisting of 438557 observations and 18 variables and the other one which is credit record(15.37MB) and it has 1048575 rows and 3 columns. Common column is client id which connects both the files.  Application record consists of client’s personal and bank information. Credit record consists of client’s credit card usage information.

## Variables

1.	ID

20.	STATUS   

## Tasks:

•	Understanding the factors that contribute for credit card approval prediction using application records and credit records datasets.

•	Identify the good and bad applicants

•	Predict credit card score through affecting factors

•	Build most accurate models to predict credit card approval

•	Create a dashboard to visualize insights from the data using the visualization tools 


## Models and Approach:

•	Logistic Classification

•	Xgboost

•	SVC Classification

•	KNN Classification

•	Random Forest Classifications

I would like to create different statistics and visualizations, including accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve, means squared error depending on the type of machine learning challenge, classification, clustering, and regression and depending on its performance, recall, and accuracy, I would choose the model that best fits the data.
